None of the BANE-127-A entities are to be interacted with. Barrier sigils have been placed in areas known to have little interaction with these entities. Once rotated off, these agents should be given amnestics and told they were doing routine work. The existence of BANE-127 is considered Hydra level security with exceptions being granted with Executive oversight.</p><p><strong>Description</strong>: This artifact was discovered deep in the ocean during Moonfall investigations. The ship appears to be Precursor in origin and would have been home to tens of thousands of people. It contains all of the amenities of a city and a military capability that far surpasses our own. Due to the effects of BANE-127-B, the extent of the damage to the ship is as of yet unknown.</p><h2 id="bane-127-a" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#bane-127-a" aria-hidden="true">#</a> BANE-127-A</h2><p>These entities appear to be precursors, but do not react to agent presence or interactions. They can, however, still cause injury to agents during the course of BANE-127-B, so caution is advised.</p><h2 id="bane-127-b" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#bane-127-b" aria-hidden="true">#</a> BANE-127-B</h2><p>BANE-127-B is the designation given to the looping anomaly currently effecting BANE-127. The entire ship seems to be going through a fifteen minute loop over and over again. The cause of this loop is, as of yet, unknown. Agents who have entered BANE-127 have become part of the loop themselves, unable to exit the ship.</p><p>This effect appears to be psychic in origin, a strong enough psychic may be able to stop agents from becoming part of the loop. Further testing is advised.</p>',8);function d(l,p){const e=s("ContainmentHeader");return n(),a("div",null,[i(e,{baneid:"127",containment:"dimension",disruption:"tarrasque",risk:"danger",securityLevel:"4"}),h])}const f=t(c,[["render",d],["__file","BANE-127.html.vue"]]);export{f as default};
