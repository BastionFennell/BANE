Within this swamp are creatures that seem to be made of several limbs from different creatures brought together to form a single monstrosity, labelled BANE-5034-3-A codename &quot;Guillotines&quot;. Entities of type BANE-5034-3-A seem to be perfectly suited for the swamp like terrain, using their environment to their advantage to ruthlessly maim and kill BANE agents. One constant is that each of these entities have incredibly sharp blades that they wield with perfect precision to amputate limbs, which they keep a hold of.</p><p>A second entity, labelled BANE-5034-3-B codename &quot;Krampus&quot;, was noted to always be found near groups of BANE-5034-3-A entities. The BANE-5034-3-B entity was of a similar design, made by pieces of many creatures pulled together, but had several hollow cavities within its body that BANE-5034-3-A entities would place severed body parts into.</p><h2 id="level-two-information" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#level-two-information" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Level Two Information</h2><p>Agent ██████ ██████████ confirmed that several body parts were found in the central spire and were being sewn together to create new entities of types BANE-5034-3-A, BANE-5034-3-B, and other as of yet labelled monstrosities. There was a clear leader, BANE-5034-3-LORD codename &quot;The Scientist&quot;, that directed several entities of type BANE-5034-3-C codename &quot;Researcher&quot; to experiment on the limbs that were gathered by entities BANE-5034-3-A and BANE-5034-3-B.</p><h2 id="level-three-information" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#level-three-information" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Level Three Information</h2>',7),c={href:"https://github.com/BastionFennell/BANE/wiki/BANE-5034-6",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},p={href:"https://github.com/BastionFennell/BANE/wiki/BANE-5034-6",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},m={href:"https://github.com/BastionFennell/BANE/wiki/BANE-4812",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},f=t("p",null,"Agent ██████ ██████████ reported that the entities around and within BANE-5034-3 did not attempt to immediately kill the forward agents.
