See individual anomaly pages for more information on these sub-anomalies.</p><p>During the time period of the incident, six increasingly powerful earthquakes were experienced in various parts of Convergence. It is assumed that with each earthquake, a spire made its way into the material plane from one of the outer planes. This was a world-wide phenomena, with spires appearing on all three major continents, Moonfall, and the Golden Isle.</p><p>BANE forward scouts reported two spires in the northern lands of Unaris, one in the eastern islands of Moonfall, one in the southern lands of the Golden Isle, one in the eastern lands of Cresten, and on far in the northern reaches. Each of these towers is producing some sort of signal that disrupts BANE communications, this signal was first noted on the final day on the final earthquake. <strong>Addendum:</strong> It appears this signal is growing in strength and radius over time.</p><h2 id="level-one-information" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#level-one-information" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Level One Information</h2><p>This is not a place of honor.
