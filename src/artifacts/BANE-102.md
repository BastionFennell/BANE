**Description**: BANE-102 seems to be a normal looking package of children’s crayons from the ████████ region. Initial inspection does not reveal any sort of anomalous properties.

BANE-102 was brought into BANE custody on ██████████. At some point after this they were brought home for a BANE ritual by ████████████████. They were last seen in the possession of ████████████ ███████ █████████████ █████████████████.

## Level One Information

This is not a place of honor. What is here is as dangerous in your time as it was in ours. Within this chamber is a tool of creation with no known limits. It has created and destroyed entire worlds. It can destroy your world as well. It cannot be used for good, it will corrupt and distort any good intention. This is not a place of honor.

## Level Two Information

These crayons, when used to draw something, will bring it to life once the drawing is bathed in moonlight. The drawing will be of the scale, intelligence, and temperament the creator intended it to be of initially. These living drawings seem to be able to be destroyed by normal means and have the same combat prowess as whatever their creator intended.

## Level Three Information

Bane-102 is more effective the younger the user is. Young users can create entire worlds, while older users can only create smaller entities. Possibility: Is this world one that was created previously by BANE-102?

Incident BANE-102-1 was a catastrophic incident in which the town of ██████████ was entirely destroyed by a drawing of a dragon. By the time BANE agents arrived on the site, BANE-102-1-1 had already destroyed the entire town. After destroying BANE-102-1-1, Agents on sight stopped the resulting fires throughout the town and contained the incident by spreading rumors of nearby bandit attacks that relied on fire.
