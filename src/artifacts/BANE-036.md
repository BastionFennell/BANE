**Containment Procedures**: None, BANE-036 has been added to Special Task Force █████ and is to be treated as any other BANE agent.

**Description**: At some point, BANE-036-A was opened. Despite further use of class Y-2 mnestics, researchers have not been able to ascertain when or how the briefcase was opened. Furthermore, despite the efforts of dimensional research, the demonology department, the librarians, ███████ ███, and Dr. Vigorblood themselves, BANE has not yet learned what, if anything, changed when the briefcase was opened.

Interviews with BANE-036 suggest that he "operates according to slightly different rules" now, though he hasn't been able to explain what he means. His experience with BANE and incredible skill as a field agent has lead to the decision to bring him on full time in this iteration of BANE.

_Researchers Note: I told you we should have gotten rid of it! Who knows what's changed now..._

**Containment Procedures**: BANE-036 is kept in a multi-layer plexiglass room under 24/7 surveillance. Thrice daily, assigned agents should provide pre-approved entertainment as requested by BANE-036. The pre-approved options are:

- Up to two hours of radio on non-talk stations
- Up to one hour of an agent reading a book from the BANE approved library out loud
- Up to one hour of discussion. BANE-036 may request an agent of his choice. Should that agent be available, they may accept this request. BANE-036 seems particularly fond of Agent ████ ████████
- Up to one hour of educational lecture from a BANE researcher
- A magazine against the containment chamber, with the help of an agent to turn the pages
- Basic BANE approved puzzles may be shown against the containment chamber, such as crosswords or sudoku

**Description**: BANE-036 is a young man named Edward of apparent age ██ who has been contained within BANE for at least ███ years. BANE-036 was originally a principal BANE forward field agent who came across an anomalous artifact, BANE-036-A, during one of his field missions. When the agent returned, BANE-036-A was handcuffed to his wrist and he spoke at length of needing assistance to get to the outer planes in order to deliver BANE-036-A and be rid of it. This request was denied until further research has been performed.

BANE-036-A is a simple black leather briefcase with a rotation lock keeping it shut. According to Edward, the briefcase holds the sixth fundamental force of nature, a force from a different place that is yet to exist here. He says he was told that if the briefcase were to be opened in the inner realms, physics as a whole would be changed and have to be rewritten. When asked who told him this, Edward neglected to answer.

## Level Two Information

Records confirm that Edward ███████ was a BANE agent in our realm and realm-████. In our realm, Edward rose to the ranks of acting field director and was instrumental in creating a successful new agent training program and field manuals.

## Level Three Information

Class Y-2 mnestics were used by researchers to confirm that BANE-036 had encountered known entity ██ █████ █████, confirming the veracity of his claims and what is likely inside the briefcase. Testing on or with BANE-036 is to be immediately halted.

_Researchers Note: Why is he still here? This is a ticking time bomb, we need to release him immediately!_
