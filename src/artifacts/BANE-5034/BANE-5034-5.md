**Spire Lord**: Zoth, the Relentless General

**Location**: This Spire is in the Northern Reaches.

**Description**: Thus far ██ teams have been sent, with █ team members returning. Large fires and smoke can be seen around the spire.

The █████████████ squad was able to perform some short reconnaissance as part of a separate mission. The spire has been fortified and has a military base forming at the ground level. Troops matching the description of previous Zoth encounters were seen in the hundreds, likely with more deeper within the spire. They have formed several forward scouting crews and have started securing areas further and further away from the military base.
