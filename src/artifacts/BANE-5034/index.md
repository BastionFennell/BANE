**Containment Procedures**: Unknown

**Description**: BANE-5034 is the name given to the collective event of BANE-5034-1 through BANE-5034-6 rising suddenly through the ground over the period of approximately three days. See individual anomaly pages for more information on these sub-anomalies.

During the time period of the incident, six increasingly powerful earthquakes were experienced in various parts of Convergence. It is assumed that with each earthquake, a spire made its way into the material plane from one of the outer planes. This was a world-wide phenomena, with spires appearing on all three major continents, Moonfall, and the Golden Isle.

BANE forward scouts reported two spires in the northern lands of Unaris, one in the eastern islands of Moonfall, one in the southern lands of the Golden Isle, one in the eastern lands of Cresten, and on far in the northern reaches. Each of these towers is producing some sort of signal that disrupts BANE communications, this signal was first noted on the final day on the final earthquake. **Addendum:** It appears this signal is growing in strength and radius over time.

## Level One Information

This is not a place of honor. What is here is as dangerous in your time as it was in ours. Within this chamber is a tool of creation with no known limits. It has created and destroyed entire worlds. It can destroy your world as well. It cannot be used for good, it will corrupt and distort any good intention. This is not a place of honor.

## Level Two Information

These spires originated from a different plane or several different planes, as confirmed by agents ██████ █████████████, ██████ ██████████, █████, and ███████ █████████. Source of the communications issue was revealed by agent ██████ ██████████ to be a leak of internal information. This incident has been upgraded to Tarrasque status as we have already lost ██ forward discovery teams due to the communication blackouts.

### Level Three Information

[BANE-4812](https://github.com/BastionFennell/BANE/wiki/BANE-4812) was first discovered ██/██/████ which lead to breakthroughs in Dr. Lumen's planar research due to its ability to exist in multiple planes at once. Forward teams have discovered that at least two of the spires are powered by this same material in much larger quantities. It is suspected that the main portion of [BANE-4812](https://github.com/BastionFennell/BANE/wiki/BANE-4812) that wasn't retrieved is powering one of those two spires.
