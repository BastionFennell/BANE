**Spire Lord**: Merida, the Black Queen

**Location**: This is the western most spire in Unaris, near the western deltas.

**Description**: Thus far ██ teams have been sent, with █ team members returning.

Initial exploration was completed by the █████████████ squad, but has yet to be confirmed by a follow up squad. The spire sits in a demi-plane between the material plane and the dream plane. It is styled like a grand castle, with many floors, ornate decorations, and dozens of guests. Most of the guests are infernal, but other groups were present as well.

There are reports from nearby areas of emissaries of the Black Queen approaching local lords and ladies to try and negotiate for control of their land.

## Merida, the Black Queen

Merida is a succubus originally hailing from realm ███. She was caught by BANE agents from that realm, but after incident ████ she was trapped inside of an interdimensional projector. The █████████████ squad unintentionally released her but managed to maintain BANE control of the projector. Her powers include charming, seduction, dream manipulation, matter manipulation, and infernal magic.
