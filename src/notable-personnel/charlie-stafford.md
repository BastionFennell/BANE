**Full Name**: Charlie Stafford

**Title**: Head of Records

**Notes**: Charlie Stafford keeps BANE running. He's been a star BANE employee for more than 5 years. The entire organization depends on his endless hours of hard work, and impeccable documentation management. Basically, I do all the important work here. I'm pretty sure I could handle any of these missions way better than our field agents, but I'm stuck behind a desk all day. They couldn't write their way out of a wet paper bag. It's a good thing they found me to keep up the quality of our records.
